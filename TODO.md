# To - Do List

These are what I have in mind:

### Code Cleanup Tasks
- [ ] Attempt to cleanup `backend/web_api/fields.py` implementation.
- [ ] Refactor the CSS files to SCSS.
- [ ] Attempt to implement a component that can handle both delay and autoscroll functionality currently implemented in several components.
- [ ] Cleanup unused database fields.

### Feature Change Tasks
- [ ] Attempt to migrate to TailwindCSS.
- [ ] Attempt to create static builds; possibly to be hosted on Github Pages.
